# Final Project for IT114
## By Nathaniel Gile

I will be making a Trivia board game. Basically, every round the game selects a random question
from a category, either random or choosen by the last player to get a question right.
The objective is to get enough questions correct as fast as possible, in order to make it to 
the end of the board. The first player to answer the question correct will move the most, and
then it descends from there. Planned trivia categories may include: Movies, Geography, History, 
Video Games, etc.
